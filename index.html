        Over the past 8 years in the NFL, Russell Wilson has been one of the most
        underrated QBs to have ever played the game. Not only has he led his team to back to back superbowls,
        but he has continuously done it while being underused and underappreciated by football fans alike.
        This webiste is dedicated to clarifying how good he has been in the past, as well as to how he can
        become the NFL's MVP this season as long as management<br> LETS. HIM. COOK.

    <div class="container bg-gray">
      <p class="mt-4 pt-2 pb-2">
        Here are just some highlights of what he can do:
        <ul class="pb-2">
        <li class="pb-1">Russell Wilson has thrown <strong>more TD's than any other player</strong> since 2018 (PFF).</li>
        <li class="pb-1">In 2019, with 31 touchdowns and <em>only</em> 5 interceptions, Russ earned a 91.1 grade and was the Unanimous PFF MVP of the year.</li>
        <li class="pb-1">In his 8 years, the Seahawks have posted a winning season (over 8 wins out of a possible 16), something that only one other team has accomplished in that span.</li>
        <li class="pb-1">With 236 Touchdowns in his career and only 69 interceptions, he averages 6 touchdowns per interception thrown. This is the best ratio for someone through their first 8 seasons in the NFL.</li>
        </ul>

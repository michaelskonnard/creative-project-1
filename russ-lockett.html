          Tyler Lockett, like Russell Wilson, has been
          <strong>INCREDIBLY</strong> underrated throughout his career. In 2019,
          Lockett was 8th in total touchdowns while having drastically less
          targets throughout the year. He Began his career as a punt/kick
          returner until he was discovered as a true WR1 in the league. His roll
          with Russell has been to run every possible route on the field. You
          can see him running crosses, out-routes, go-routes, hooks, screens,
          and even fades. As a jack of all trades, its near impossible for
          defenders to know what he will be doing on the next play.

      <div class="container bg-gray mt-2 pt-2 pb-1">
        <p>
          Russell and Tyler must have sometype of telepathic communication
          because when Russell scrambles, Lockett is always there to throw a
          block or to catch a last second throw for a big gain. In 2019 against
          the Rams, Lockett caught the 2nd most <em>improbable</em> catch of the
          NFL over the past 2 years. With a catch probability of 6.3%, Lockett
          only had 0.9 yards of space from the defender and 0.2 yards of space
          from the out of bounds line. This connection can be
          <strong>DEADLY</strong>.

          With DK developing in his abilities, Russ can easily take advantage of
          his teammates massive stature as he runs down the field like a
          battleship.

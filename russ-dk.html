          DK Metcalf was drafted 64th overall in the late 2nd round of the 2019
          NFL Draft. After having a lack luster Senior year, many doubted that
          he would pan out in the NFL as a receiver due to his pure sizing.
          Since joining the NFL, he has over 1000 yards receiving, 9 touchdowns,
          and averaging 16.5 yards per reception. These are
          <strong>BEAST</strong> numbers for someone who has barely started his
          sophmore season. In his most recent game, he matched up against the
          2019 Defensive Player of the Year, Stephon Gilmore, and demolished in.
          He cut quicker on his routes and was aided by Russell's pinpoint
          accuracy on every deep pass.

          With DK developing in his abilities, Russ can easily take advantage of
          his teammates massive stature as he runs down the field like a
          battleship.
